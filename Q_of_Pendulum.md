There's a pendulum with two mass centers that are connected with a solid bar. The bar's mass can be ignored.

Let's consider if there's a car connected with one mass center fixed on it. And the car moves at arbitrary velocity along a thin track while the pendulum moving
freely (360 degrees available). 

How do you simulate the movement of the other mass center (we may call it as target now)? Given car may move in 2 modes i) always in one direction ii) back and forth within a distant $L$ with maximum velocity $v$.

Can you make it upside-down?

Here's a demonstration:

 This is an open question. Assume everything you need, including setting, and show your implementation as detailed as possible.
